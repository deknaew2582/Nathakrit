Project Data (Use this data to populate the pages):

Project 1:

id: data-visualization-oee

title: Data Visualization for OEE Improvement

client: CPF Food & Beverage Co. Ltd

year: 2023

service: AI & Machine Learning

technologies: Python, FastAPI, MQTT, PostgreSQL, Time-Series Analysis

challenge: "A factory's production line had a low Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of 20%, but the specific causes and bottlenecks were unknown due to a lack of real-time data."

solution: "I developed a system to stream machine data every minute using MQTT, created APIs with FastAPI to process it, and performed time-series analysis to pinpoint inefficiencies."

results: "The insights from the data allowed for targeted improvements that boosted the factory's OEE from 20% to over 80% within a few days, dramatically increasing production efficiency."

Project 2:

id: object-detection-factory

title: AI Object Detection for Quality Control

client: CPF Food & Beverage Co. Ltd

year: 2023

service: AI & Machine Learning

technologies: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, PySide6, Modbus, Docker

challenge: "Manual quality control on a food production line was slow, labor-intensive, and prone to human error, risking product quality."

solution: "I engineered an end-to-end system using a hyper-spectral camera and a custom-trained AI model with 100% recall. The system was deployed on an edge device and integrated with the factory PLC via Modbus for automated rejection."

results: "The system fully automated quality control, ensuring perfect accuracy, improving product safety, and operating in real-time without slowing down the production line."

Project 3:

id: aquaculture-prediction

title: Predictive App for Aquaculture Farms

client: Khonkaen University

year: 2022

service: AI & Machine Learning

technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Flask, React, Firebase

challenge: "Aquaculture farms needed a way to proactively manage water quality to ensure optimal growth and health of aquatic life, preventing potential losses."

solution: "I developed a full-stack application that used sensor data and a machine learning model to forecast water quality. The system included automated data transfer from edge devices and a web app with notifications."

results: "The application provided farm operators with actionable forecasts, allowing them to maintain optimal water quality, reduce costs, and maximize stock survival rates."

Project 4:

id: weighing-app

title: Legacy Weighing App Modernization

client: Freelance Client

year: 2023

service: Desktop Applications

technologies: Python, PySide6, Modbus TCP, SQLite

challenge: "A client was using an outdated and inflexible weighing machine application that hindered their operational speed and accuracy."

solution: "I re-engineered the legacy system into a modern, user-friendly desktop app using PySide6. The new system connected directly with PLCs via Modbus TCP and used a local SQLite database for reliable data storage."

results: "The new application significantly improved operational speed, data accuracy, and workflow flexibility, giving the client a more powerful and reliable tool."

Project 5:

id: nurse-tracking-app

title: Nurse Activity Tracking App

client: Freelance Client

year: 2023

service: Web Applications

technologies: React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT

challenge: "A medical facility needed a digital solution to streamline patient care documentation and improve workflow analysis for nursing staff."

solution: "I developed a comprehensive full-stack web application with secure authentication, a digital patient records system, and an interface for hourly activity logging. A dashboard generated summaries and charts for analysis."

results: "The system digitized and streamlined patient care documentation, enabling clear, real-time reporting and providing management with data to improve workflow and staffing decisions."

Project 6:

id: agricultural-store

title: E-commerce Platform for Agricultural Store

client: Freelance Client

year: 2022

service: Web Applications

technologies: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, NGINX, SSL

challenge: "An agricultural store with over 20,000 products needed a custom, high-performance e-commerce platform to manage its massive inventory and scale its online sales."

solution: "I architected and developed a full-stack e-commerce platform from scratch, featuring an intuitive admin console for easy management. The entire system was containerized with Docker and deployed on a custom-configured, SSL-secured server."

results: "The platform provided the client with a robust, scalable, and secure solution to manage and sell their products online, directly enabling business growth."

Project 7:

id: image-labeling-app

title: Autonomous Image Labelling App

client: Personal Project

year: 2024

service: AI & Machine Learning

technologies: React, Python, FastAPI, OpenCV

challenge: "The process of manually labeling thousands of images for computer vision datasets is extremely time-consuming and tedious, creating a bottleneck for AI development."

solution: "I created a web-based, locally-run application to automate and accelerate the image labeling process. The tool helps pre-label images using AI models, requiring only minor corrections from the user."

results: "This internal tool significantly reduces the manual effort and time required to prepare high-quality data for training computer vision models."

Project 8:

id: face-recognition-system

title: Facial Recognition Attendance System

client: Personal Project

year: 2021

service: AI & Machine Learning

technologies: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, PyQt

challenge: "Taking student attendance manually can be inefficient and inaccurate. I wanted to build an automated solution using facial recognition."

solution: "I built and trained a facial recognition model with 95% accuracy using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The desktop application could identify registered students from a live CCTV feed, detect unregistered faces, and even measure emotional sentiment."

results: "The project is a successful proof-of-concept for an automated system that can enhance classroom monitoring and streamline attendance tracking."
